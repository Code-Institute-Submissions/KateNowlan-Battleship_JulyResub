Battleship is a python based web application run in a mock terminal.
It is a game where you need to guess where the opponents ships are on a board to sink them.The person who has sunk all the ships first wins.

## User Experience:

### Vision:
- The user is welcomed at the beginning of the game and asked for their name. This inititates the start of the game. 
- The board then sets up for you to make youe first guess to try sink a ship.
- You carry on until all your turns are up and you are told whether you win or lose.

This game is easy and straightforward and no two games will be the same as the ships are randomly placed on the board thanks to a python library called random.

### Target Audience:
